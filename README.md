# TriviaGame

The goal of the game is to answer as many questions as you can correctly. If you answer more than 5 correct (6+), you win. If you go below that, you lose.

The most frustrating but also the best thing about this game is that I'm starting to learn a lot about functions and objects and getting the hang out how to use them. 

Right now it doesn't look too flashy (not at all actually) but only because I wanted to truly nail the logic first before I could do anything. There were other things I would've loved to do, like adding a next button during transitions between questions, or add pictures that relate to the correct answer of each question. There were a lot of extra things I would've loved to add on, and maybe I will in the future, but for now the basics work great. I truly am proud that I got to do this all on my own... with a little help of a video or two! That's definitely an accomplishment. 

The logic could be a little more organized, but I wasn't sure if moving things around would mess with the game. Anyways, I hope you enjoy the game. I had fun making it.
